# Philosophy lecture 5

So far discussion on the nature of philosophy and thinking. Trying to define scope for philosophisizing. 
**Branches of Philosophy**: Ethics, Metaphysics, Epistemology, etc. Philosophy began with metaphysics.  
Metaphysics: Most fundamental. Questions like what is existence, what are values, what is the nature of existence of human minds. Study of the nature of everything in the universe.  
Distinction between metaphysics and science: Some philosophers believe all philosophical discussion ought to be metaphysical (eg Garcia). Turning point in philosophy where metaphysics was considered relevent in the 17th century (Rennesaince). Logically sound philosophers would dismiss metaphysics and shift to science happened.  
 Logical positivism was a more serious turning point: If philosophical statements don't reflect reality they are consideered meaningless. X is meaningful iff X has a reference in the real world. People though there is an ultimate nature not comprehensible to human perception but positivism rejected it.  
 Aristotle brought in this division with his books on physics and metaphysics (That which comes after physics). There is an interpretation: metaphysics is the study of things not knowable through physics. Eg. Freedom of will, existence of god etc. Aristotle divided reality into three categories [readlater]:  
Beings(Ontology) : The science of "qua being". The general nature of existence. These things can be well measured in experiments for example. Understanding the properties of things that exist. Eg. Problem of hard problem of consciousness. Mind is not the same as brain process. Existence of numbers is an ontological question.   
**Note: This is very unclear, look up definition elsewhere**     
Other kind of metaphysics is theology. Study of highest nature of existence.    
Finally first principle: Look for universal truths of every existing thing. Eg Causality.
